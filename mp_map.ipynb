To put it in context, this Government spend more money on polling and focus groups than any Government in history. There may be good reason for that, but for the past year, they have adamantly resisted all freedom of information requests about that subject. I put in five named day questions on specific elements of it. Not one of them was answered on time; indeed, not one of them has been answered yet. This is not unusual: other Departments also resist answering named day questions, and this is an instrument that is critical for holding Governments to account. This was the Cabinet Office, but other Departments do the same. Mr Speaker, May I ask you to get the House authorities to speak to the Government about meeting these guidelines, so that our attempts to hold them to account are more effective?</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is with a keen sense of pride, privilege and pleasure that first I welcome you, Mr. Parker, to the Chair and congratulate you on becoming Father of the House, in succession to our greatly respected friend George Strauss, and then respectfully submit to the House the motion,\\n That the Rt. Hon. George Thomas do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\\n We share today a common purpose â€” the election of our Speaker â€” but I would guess that perhaps that is not the only thing that we share today. I am sure that we are all glad to exchange aspiration for actuality and the hustings for the House, and are glad to find ourselves in a place â€” one of the few, perhaps the only one â€” where politicians as a class are held in universal love and unqualified respect.\\n Alas, that is not so everywhere, but at least nobody here would share the opinion given to a colleague of mine, in my ministerial days, who had been unwise enough to enter into verbal disputation with a doctor â€” something I learned early not to do. They always have the last word anyway.\\n The Minister said \"There are two sorts of doctor â€” the young and experimental, who kill you off, and the old and traditional, who leave you to die\". The doctor replied \"Yes, Minister, and there are two sorts of politician â€” those who are dead and those who ought to be\".\\n In this great democracy of ours, no one can sit in the House without free and popular election. That applies to Mr. Speaker twice over. He has to be doubly elected on a free and popular vote â€” first by his constituents and again by his fellow Members. He is, in accordance with our constitutional principle of the discontinuity of Parliaments, a new Speaker for a new Parliament. It is therefore a new Speaker for this new Parliament that we elect today, even though he will come to the Chair with the unbounded respect and affection derived from his previous tenure of office.\\n Our new Speaker will be elected by a House containing many new Members. Perhaps, as this is the first speech of the new Parliament, I may, without presumption, be allowed a word of welcome to our new Members. Over the years, I have heard, as, I dare say, have you, Mr. Parker, new Members sometimes referring to themselves with becoming modesty as \"new boys\". But there is no such distinction here. In the House of Commons, as in the eyes of God, all are equal. Only Mr. Speaker, as arbiter and interpreter of our proceedings, as a symbol of the high authority of Parliament, stands perhaps a little apart â€” primus inter pares â€” rather than one of the boys.\\n One and all, Mr. Speaker and the rest, new Members and old, are part of a goodly company and heirs to a great tradition, exercising on behalf of those we here represent those democratic rights and freedoms taken perhaps for granted through long enjoyment in this country, but envied by many people in many lands who have them not. They are like the air that we breathe â€” little noticed in their presence but valued beyond price in the event of deprivation.\\n So, no doubt, Mr. Speaker will be according the customary priority to those who wish to make their maiden speech. Most of them, no doubt, will be delivered with traditional maiden modesty, but perhaps here and there we may have the speech of an F. E. Smith, or a maiden speech like that of my very dear and wholly delightful friend the late Alan Herbert in respect of which Sir Winston Churchill said \"That was not a maiden speech, it was a painted hussy of a speech\". The mention of those two and the recollection of many others, of\\n the simple great ones gone for ever and ever by\\n whose company and conversation I was, when younger, privileged sometimes to enjoy emboldens me to entertain the hope that I may enjoy the privilege from time to time of the company and conversation of those who join us now.\\n The duties of Mr. Speaker are to well known to require any description by me. On him falls the duty of interpreting our rules and guiding our proceedings. On him falls too the duty of ensuring compliance with the text in verse 40 of the fourteenth chapter of the first epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians:\\n Let all things be done decently and in order.\\n I am sure that that task will be lightened by the political equivalent of ecumenical assent to that exemplary and authoritative exhortation.\\n In all his tasks Mr. Speaker will have the inestimable advantage not only of his own experience, judgment and fair-mindedness but of the unfailing help and ready guidance of the learned Clerks at the Table, who are held by us all in such great respect.\\n Among the duties of Mr. Speaker is the difficult and delicate task of the selection of hon. Members to address the House, and that imposes the unwelcome duty sometimes to disappoint â€” a duty imposed not of choice but by the inexorable logistics of the quart and the pint pot.\\n I warn our new Members that there will be times, once those excellent maiden speeches have been made, when, amid a cluster of competing claimants, they will not be able to catch Mr. Speaker's eye. They will go home, as have we all, at the end of a long and frustrating day with their notes in their pockets and their hearts in their boots, reflecting sadly on the melancholy, but inescapable, paradox that the speeches that we fail to make are somehow and sadly almost always better than those we do make.\\n Those hon. Members will be sad, but so will Mr. Speaker. Perhaps he will not be as sad as they â€” I do not want to use the language of hyperbole â€” but he will be genuinely sorry because he is a kind and warm-hearted man.\\n It is obvious that for the performance of these varied and exacting duties we need someone of good judgment and rare quality. It is equally obvious that in the right hon. Gentleman we have such a man.\\n When I had the honour to second his initial election as Speaker, I said this:\\n He is richly endowed with those qualities that make a good parliamentarian and a much-loved colleague â€” not only eloquence and judgment, although he has both in good measure, but courtesy and consideration, affability and sensibility, kindliness and good humour, and a wit that often scores but never wounds.\" â€”  [Official Report, 3 February 1976; Vol. 904, c. 1136.]\\n Today I reaffirm those words. But I do more. I do not need now to prophesy his fitness for the office of Speaker. I can point to the record. In the words of a great and much-loved parliamentarian, why peer into the crystal when we can read the book? Now, after three years and more, we can surely read the book. What I said then as to his quality is confirmed and proven clear beyond the possibility of peradventure.\\n What was then expectation is now realisation. What was then confident surmise is now established fact. What was then aspiration for the future is now present certainty based on the solid foundation of past performance.\\n If I may be allowed, in conclusion, what would normally be the almost unpardonable indulgence of a slight adaptation, to meet the happier circumstances of our scene today, of Shakespeare's lines in one of my favourite plays,\\n His life is gentle; and the elements\\n So mixed in him that Nature might stand up\\n And say to all the world 'This is the man'\\n This, then, is the man. The right hon. Gentleman is the man for us to be Speaker of our House.\\n It is therefore in a spirit of confidence and conviction, with feelings of warm friendship and deep respect, that I submit the right hon. Gentleman's election to the assent and approbation of the House.</td>\n",

The hon. Lady will have noticed that last year the coronavirus occupied almost everything we were doing, but it did not prevent us issuing a new cycling strategy, published by the Prime Minister and backed by me. We will be saying a lot more about that, and I welcome the hon. Ladyâ€™s enthusiasm.</td>\n",

       "2        My hon. Friend is a brilliant champion of connectivity for her constituency, and as a result, my right hon. Friend the Transport Secretary was in north Wales early this week, discussing plans to upgrade the A55 with the Welsh Conservative candidate standing in Mayâ€™s election. We look forward to the final Union connectivity review recommendations ahead of the spending review, in which we will consider funding plans for delivering improved UK-wide connectivity. However, I must say to the hon. Lady that the fastest way for her constituents to secure upgrades to the A55 is to vote for a Welsh Conservative Government, who have pledged to end Labourâ€™s neglect of north Wales.

       "4        On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As a further letter of complaint, I want to raise with you the problem of Government Departments not meeting the guidelines for named day questions. To put it in context, this Government spend more money on polling and focus groups than any Government in history. There may be good reason for that, but for the past year, they have adamantly resisted all freedom of information requests about that subject. I put in five named day questions on specific elements of it. Not one of them was answered on time; indeed, not one of them has been answered yet. This is not unusual: other Departments also resist answering named day questions, and this is an instrument that is critical for holding Governments to account. This was the Cabinet Office, but other Departments do the same. Mr Speaker, May I ask you to get the House authorities to speak to the Government about meeting these guidelines, so that our attempts to hold them to account are more effective?

       "16       It is with a keen sense of pride, privilege and pleasure that first I welcome you, Mr. Parker, to the Chair and congratulate you on becoming Father of the House, in succession to our greatly respected friend George Strauss, and then respectfully submit to the House the motion,\\n That the Rt. Hon. George Thomas do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\\n We share today a common purpose â€” the election of our Speaker â€” but I would guess that perhaps that is not the only thing that we share today. I am sure that we are all glad to exchange aspiration for actuality and the hustings for the House, and are glad to find ourselves in a place â€” one of the few, perhaps the only one â€” where politicians as a class are held in universal love and unqualified respect.\\n Alas, that is not so everywhere, but at least nobody here would share the opinion given to a colleague of mine, in my ministerial days, who had been unwise enough to enter into verbal disputation with a doctor â€” something I learned early not to do. They always have the last word anyway.\\n The Minister said \"There are two sorts of doctor â€” the young and experimental, who kill you off, and the old and traditional, who leave you to die\". The doctor replied \"Yes, Minister, and there are two sorts of politician â€” those who are dead and those who ought to be\".\\n In this great democracy of ours, no one can sit in the House without free and popular election. That applies to Mr. Speaker twice over. He has to be doubly elected on a free and popular vote â€” first by his constituents and again by his fellow Members. He is, in accordance with our constitutional principle of the discontinuity of Parliaments, a new Speaker for a new Parliament. It is therefore a new Speaker for this new Parliament that we elect today, even though he will come to the Chair with the unbounded respect and affection derived from his previous tenure of office.\\n Our new Speaker will be elected by a House containing many new Members. Perhaps, as this is the first speech of the new Parliament, I may, without presumption, be allowed a word of welcome to our new Members. Over the years, I have heard, as, I dare say, have you, Mr. Parker, new Members sometimes referring to themselves with becoming modesty as \"new boys\". But there is no such distinction here. In the House of Commons, as in the eyes of God, all are equal. Only Mr. Speaker, as arbiter and interpreter of our proceedings, as a symbol of the high authority of Parliament, stands perhaps a little apart â€” primus inter pares â€” rather than one of the boys.\\n One and all, Mr. Speaker and the rest, new Members and old, are part of a goodly company and heirs to a great tradition, exercising on behalf of those we here represent those democratic rights and freedoms taken perhaps for granted through long enjoyment in this country, but envied by many people in many lands who have them not. They are like the air that we breathe â€” little noticed in their presence but valued beyond price in the event of deprivation.\\n So, no doubt, Mr. Speaker will be according the customary priority to those who wish to make their maiden speech. Most of them, no doubt, will be delivered with traditional maiden modesty, but perhaps here and there we may have the speech of an F. E. Smith, or a maiden speech like that of my very dear and wholly delightful friend the late Alan Herbert in respect of which Sir Winston Churchill said \"That was not a maiden speech, it was a painted hussy of a speech\". The mention of those two and the recollection of many others, of\\n the simple great ones gone for ever and ever by\\n whose company and conversation I was, when younger, privileged sometimes to enjoy emboldens me to entertain the hope that I may enjoy the privilege from time to time of the company and conversation of those who join us now.\\n The duties of Mr. Speaker are to well known to require any description by me. On him falls the duty of interpreting our rules and guiding our proceedings. On him falls too the duty of ensuring compliance with the text in verse 40 of the fourteenth chapter of the first epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians:\\n Let all things be done decently and in order.\\n I am sure that that task will be lightened by the political equivalent of ecumenical assent to that exemplary and authoritative exhortation.\\n In all his tasks Mr. Speaker will have the inestimable advantage not only of his own experience, judgment and fair-mindedness but of the unfailing help and ready guidance of the learned Clerks at the Table, who are held by us all in such great respect.\\n Among the duties of Mr. Speaker is the difficult and delicate task of the selection of hon. Members to address the House, and that imposes the unwelcome duty sometimes to disappoint â€” a duty imposed not of choice but by the inexorable logistics of the quart and the pint pot.\\n I warn our new Members that there will be times, once those excellent maiden speeches have been made, when, amid a cluster of competing claimants, they will not be able to catch Mr. Speaker's eye. They will go home, as have we all, at the end of a long and frustrating day with their notes in their pockets and their hearts in their boots, reflecting sadly on the melancholy, but inescapable, paradox that the speeches that we fail to make are somehow and sadly almost always better than those we do make.\\n Those hon. Members will be sad, but so will Mr. Speaker. Perhaps he will not be as sad as they â€” I do not want to use the language of hyperbole â€” but he will be genuinely sorry because he is a kind and warm-hearted man.\\n It is obvious that for the performance of these varied and exacting duties we need someone of good judgment and rare quality. It is equally obvious that in the right hon. Gentleman we have such a man.\\n When I had the honour to second his initial election as Speaker, I said this:\\n He is richly endowed with those qualities that make a good parliamentarian and a much-loved colleague â€” not only eloquence and judgment, although he has both in good measure, but courtesy and consideration, affability and sensibility, kindliness and good humour, and a wit that often scores but never wounds.\" â€”  [Official Report, 3 February 1976; Vol. 904, c. 1136.]\\n Today I reaffirm those words. But I do more. I do not need now to prophesy his fitness for the office of Speaker. I can point to the record. In the words of a great and much-loved parliamentarian, why peer into the crystal when we can read the book? Now, after three years and more, we can surely read the book. What I said then as to his quality is confirmed and proven clear beyond the possibility of peradventure.\\n What was then expectation is now realisation. What was then confident surmise is now established fact. What was then aspiration for the future is now present certainty based on the solid foundation of past performance.\\n If I may be allowed, in conclusion, what would normally be the almost unpardonable indulgence of a slight adaptation, to meet the happier circumstances of our scene today, of Shakespeare's lines in one of my favourite plays,\\n His life is gentle; and the elements\\n So mixed in him that Nature might stand up\\n And say to all the world 'This is the man'\\n This, then, is the man. The right hon. Gentleman is the man for us to be Speaker of our House.\\n It is therefore in a spirit of confidence and conviction, with feelings of warm friendship and deep respect, that I submit the right hon. Gentleman's election to the assent and approbation of the House.   \n",

       "2694368  Given that we have Â£2 billion of funding for walking and cycling â€” the biggest sum ever invested in active travel, as far as we can work out â€” the idea that there is a lack of investment is, of course, entirely untrue. The hon. Lady will have noticed that last year the coronavirus occupied almost everything we were doing, but it did not prevent us issuing a new cycling strategy, published by the Prime Minister and backed by me. We will be saying a lot more about that, and I welcome the hon.

       "2694369  As chair of the all-party parliamentary environment group, I am incredibly supportive of the Governmentâ€™s ambition to phase out diesel trains across the entire UK network by 2040. East West Rail is soon to build a railway line in my constituency, due for completion in 2030, but it is not being built as an electrified line, and my constituents are very worried that they might end up with a new diesel railway line. Will my right hon. Friend, or my hon. Friend the Member for Redditch (Rachel Maclean) â€” I am not sure who is answering â€” work with me and the Treasury to make sure that East West Rail is aligned with the Governmentâ€™s ambition to phase out diesel trains?

       "2694370  I will answer my hon. Friend. East West Rail, the company behind the new line, is aiming to deliver an entirely zero-carbon railway. It will be considering conventional and emerging technology solutions for powering trains, which could be part-electric and part-hydrogen or battery in the future, for example, so that services that

The changes instigated by the Boundary Commission have resulted in my losing the privilege of representing Northaw and Cuffley, but gaining that for Wheathampstead.\\n May I, on behalf of my new constituents, express their appreciation to Sir Victor Goodhew who had the honour before me of serving the village and parish. I know that his considerable contribution to the political life of Hertfordshire will be remembered with both gratitude and affection.\\n Wheathampstead has already had a long and, I believe, beneficial association with the name of Murphy in an industrial and commercial context. It will be my intention to have a similar association, but rather in terms of the Palace of Westminster and this House.\\n This day's debate on the Gracious Speech is centred on industrial matters, and it is right to recognise the great importance of economic factors in the recent general election campaign. The results of that election were largely determined by the views of people on which approach to the economy was the most realistic, the most relevant, and the most likely to produce success. The outcome of such deliberation is clear.\\n Once again, the fundamental concept of freedom was laid before the electorate. On the one hand was the belief in the free market and free choice. On the other hand, to a greater or lesser degree, was the belief in state control and state decisions. Allied to a recognition of the value of freedom was enterprise, which can truly manifest itself only when allowed to be free. This Government have previously shown their positive commitment to free enterprise, and that commitment is endorsed in the Gracious Speech at the start of this new Parliament.\\n In my constituency we share the real concern for those who are unfortunately without work. At the same time, we share the great pride in developing industries, often making use of the application of new technology. Hope for the unemployed rests primarily with the expansion and creation of companies, large and small, which are prepared to invest in the future and to capitalise on opportunities that present themselves.\\n The common-sense approach of my constituents recognises the value of the entrepreneur in stimulating the local economy through his enterprise. That common sense also recognises the fundamental truth that personal freedom is preferable to state direction. In this way growth will be promoted, from which comes employment.\\n Against the background of the highly successful pursuit of policies to curb inflation and of real signs of an upturn from recession, the Gracious Speech is surely right to emphasise the value of competitiveness and efficiency. At the same time it is also surely right to pay due attention to the importance of trade to our nation. That is particularly relevant in Welwyn-Hatfield, as exports from mid-Hertfordshire are substantial.\\n As its Member of Parliament, it is my aim always to put the interests of Welwyn-Hatfield first. It is undoubtedly in the interests of my constituency, and of the country, that the Government's intentions as outlined in the Gracious Speech receive wholehearted support. That I gladly give.</td>\n",

Additionally, the commercial and employment consequences are self-evident. It is regrettable that the SDP-Liberal alliance is not represented at this debate, which is well supported by Government Members.\\n It is vital that projects such as ALARM, with which my constituency has been closely connected, should receive the support of the Ministry of Defence and the RAF. It is also vital that other projects involving British Aerospace dynamics division, such as ASRAAM, should be afforded priority consideration for relevant Government commitment. That should also be the case for projects involving the British Aerospace aircraft division, such as the A320 airbus.\\n Britain has for long provided skill and innovation in aerospace which have been a source of justifiable pride and success. Denationalising British Aerospace has added lustre to an already outstanding industry, but inevitably there remains a role for the Government as both sponsor and purchaser. I have long campaigned, with certain positive results, for due recognition to be afforded to British Aerospace projects such as the 146 aircraft, the A300 airbus, the Sea Eagle missile and ALARM. the last named deserves the early and favourable decision for which my hon.

       "1        As the newly elected Member for Welwyn-Hatfield, I am conscious that I am the first representative of this constituency, as indeed I was the last for the seat of Welwyn and Hatfield. The changes instigated by the Boundary Commission have resulted in my losing the privilege of representing Northaw and Cuffley, but gaining that for Wheathampstead.\\n May I, on behalf of my new constituents, express their appreciation to Sir Victor Goodhew who had the honour before me of serving the village and parish. I know that his considerable contribution to the political life of Hertfordshire will be remembered with both gratitude and affection.\\n Wheathampstead has already had a long and, I believe, beneficial association with the name of Murphy in an industrial and commercial context. It will be my intention to have a similar association, but rather in terms of the Palace of Westminster and this House.\\n This day's debate on the Gracious Speech is centred on industrial matters, and it is right to recognise the great importance of economic factors in the recent general election campaign. The results of that election were largely determined by the views of people on which approach to the economy was the most realistic, the most relevant, and the most likely to produce success. The outcome of such deliberation is clear.\\n Once again, the fundamental concept of freedom was laid before the electorate. On the one hand was the belief in the free market and free choice. On the other hand, to a greater or lesser degree, was the belief in state control and state decisions. Allied to a recognition of the value of freedom was enterprise, which can truly manifest itself only when allowed to be free. This Government have previously shown their positive commitment to free enterprise, and that commitment is endorsed in the Gracious Speech at the start of this new Parliament.\\n In my constituency we share the real concern for those who are unfortunately without work. At the same time, we share the great pride in developing industries, often making use of the application of new technology. Hope for the unemployed rests primarily with the expansion and creation of companies, large and small, which are prepared to invest in the future and to capitalise on opportunities that present themselves.\\n The common-sense approach of my constituents recognises the value of the entrepreneur in stimulating the local economy through his enterprise. That common sense also recognises the fundamental truth that personal freedom is preferable to state direction. In this way growth will be promoted, from which comes employment.\\n Against the background of the highly successful pursuit of policies to curb inflation and of real signs of an upturn from recession, the Gracious Speech is surely right to emphasise the value of competitiveness and efficiency. At the same time it is also surely right to pay due attention to the importance of trade to our nation. That is particularly relevant in Welwyn-Hatfield, as exports from mid-Hertfordshire are substantial.\\n As its Member of Parliament, it is my aim always to put the interests of Welwyn-Hatfield first. It is undoubtedly in the interests of my constituency, and of the country, that the Government's intentions as outlined in the Gracious Speech receive wholehearted support. That I gladly give.   \n",
       "2        As we debate ALARM and future British weapons systems, we are considering not only that most important of Governmental tasks, the defence of the realm, but the development of expertise and technology without which the nation will be the poorer in stature and the more dependent on others. Additionally, the commercial and employment consequences are self-evident. It is regrettable that the SDP-Liberal alliance is not represented at this debate, which is well supported by Government Members.\\n It is vital that projects such as ALARM, with which my constituency has been closely connected, should receive the support of the Ministry of Defence and the RAF. It is also vital that other projects involving British Aerospace dynamics division, such as ASRAAM, should be afforded priority consideration for relevant Government commitment. That should also be the case for projects involving the British Aerospace aircraft division, such as the A320 airbus.\\n Britain has for long provided skill and innovation in aerospace which have been a source of justifiable pride and success. Denationalising British Aerospace has added lustre to an already outstanding industry, but inevitably there remains a role for the Government as both sponsor and purchaser. I have long campaigned, with certain positive results, for due recognition to be afforded to British Aerospace projects such as the 146 aircraft, the A300 airbus, the Sea Eagle missile and ALARM. the last named deserves the early and favourable decision for which my hon.

People see a Conservative Government who are getting on with uniting and levelling up, with the most ambitious agenda any Government have had for generations, and I think that is what they are listening to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

It is we who share their priorities on crime, on the NHS, on investment in infrastructure and on levelling up across our country, so I hope they will vote Conservative on 6 May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1801638  I first was made aware of the plan for a European super league on, I think, the Sunday night, and we acted decisively using the arsenal of legislative freedoms that we now have thanks to leaving the European Union, which the right hon. and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer) opposed, of course. We acted decisively to make clear that the UK Government took a dim view of this matter.

They donâ€™t like focusing on the issues that actually matter to the British people and the people of West Yorkshire. \\n I thank my hon. Friend, who is absolutely right. I hope that on 6 May the people will get out and vote for a party that believes in supporting our NHS; that believes in fighting crime, not being soft on crime; and that will bring jobs and regeneration across the country. I hope that they will vote Conservative on 6 May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>As the newly elected Member for Welwyn-Hatfield, I am conscious that I am the first representative of this constituency, as indeed I was the last for the seat of Welwyn and Hatfield. The changes instigated by the Boundary Commission have resulted in my losing the privilege of representing Northaw and Cuffley, but gaining that for Wheathampstead.\\n May I, on behalf of my new constituents, express their appreciation to Sir Victor Goodhew who had the honour before me of serving the village and parish. I know that his considerable contribution to the political life of Hertfordshire will be remembered with both gratitude and affection.\\n Wheathampstead has already had a long and, I believe, beneficial association with the name of Murphy in an industrial and commercial context. It will be my intention to have a similar association, but rather in terms of the Palace of Westminster and this House.\\n This day's debate on the Gracious Speech is centred on industrial matters, and it is right to recognise the great importance of economic factors in the recent general election campaign. The results of that election were largely determined by the views of people on which approach to the economy was the most realistic, the most relevant, and the most likely to produce success. The outcome of such deliberation is clear.\\n Once again, the fundamental concept of freedom was laid before the electorate. On the one hand was the belief in the free market and free choice. On the other hand, to a greater or lesser degree, was the belief in state control and state decisions. Allied to a recognition of the value of freedom was enterprise, which can truly manifest itself only when allowed to be free. This Government have previously shown their positive commitment to free enterprise, and that commitment is endorsed in the Gracious Speech at the start of this new Parliament.\\n In my constituency we share the real concern for those who are unfortunately without work. At the same time, we share the great pride in developing industries, often making use of the application of new technology. Hope for the unemployed rests primarily with the expansion and creation of companies, large and small, which are prepared to invest in the future and to capitalise on opportunities that present themselves.\\n The common-sense approach of my constituents recognises the value of the entrepreneur in stimulating the local economy through his enterprise. That common sense also recognises the fundamental truth that personal freedom is preferable to state direction. In this way growth will be promoted, from which comes employment.\\n Against the background of the highly successful pursuit of policies to curb inflation and of real signs of an upturn from recession, the Gracious Speech is surely right to emphasise the value of competitiveness and efficiency. At the same time it is also surely right to pay due attention to the importance of trade to our nation. That is particularly relevant in Welwyn-Hatfield, as exports from mid-Hertfordshire are substantial.\\n As its Member of Parliament, it is my aim always to put the interests of Welwyn-Hatfield first. It is undoubtedly in the interests of my constituency, and of the country, that the Government's intentions as outlined in the Gracious Speech receive wholehearted support. That I gladly give.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As we debate ALARM and future British weapons systems, we are considering not only that most important of Governmental tasks, the defence of the realm, but the development of expertise and technology without which the nation will be the poorer in stature and the more dependent on others. Additionally, the commercial and employment consequences are self-evident. It is regrettable that the SDP-Liberal alliance is not represented at this debate, which is well supported by Government Members.\\n It is vital that projects such as ALARM, with which my constituency has been closely connected, should receive the support of the Ministry of Defence and the RAF. It is also vital that other projects involving British Aerospace dynamics division, such as ASRAAM, should be afforded priority consideration for relevant Government commitment. That should also be the case for projects involving the British Aerospace aircraft division, such as the A320 airbus.\\n Britain has for long provided skill and innovation in aerospace which have been a source of justifiable pride and success. Denationalising British Aerospace has added lustre to an already outstanding industry, but inevitably there remains a role for the Government as both sponsor and purchaser. I have long campaigned, with certain positive results, for due recognition to be afforded to British Aerospace projects such as the 146 aircraft, the A300 airbus, the Sea Eagle missile and ALARM. the last named deserves the early and favourable decision for which my hon. Friend I are rightly pressing tonight.</td>\n",

       "1        As the newly elected Member for Welwyn-Hatfield, I am conscious that I am the first representative of this constituency, as indeed I was the last for the seat of Welwyn and Hatfield. The changes instigated by the Boundary Commission have resulted in my losing the privilege of representing Northaw and Cuffley, but gaining that for Wheathampstead.\\n May I, on behalf of my new constituents, express their appreciation to Sir Victor Goodhew who had the honour before me of serving the village and parish. I know that his considerable contribution to the political life of Hertfordshire will be remembered with both gratitude and affection.\\n Wheathampstead has already had a long and, I believe, beneficial association with the name of Murphy in an industrial and commercial context. It will be my intention to have a similar association, but rather in terms of the Palace of Westminster and this House.\\n This day's debate on the Gracious Speech is centred on industrial matters, and it is right to recognise the great importance of economic factors in the recent general election campaign. The results of that election were largely determined by the views of people on which approach to the economy was the most realistic, the most relevant, and the most likely to produce success. The outcome of such deliberation is clear.\\n Once again, the fundamental concept of freedom was laid before the electorate. On the one hand was the belief in the free market and free choice. On the other hand, to a greater or lesser degree, was the belief in state control and state decisions. Allied to a recognition of the value of freedom was enterprise, which can truly manifest itself only when allowed to be free. This Government have previously shown their positive commitment to free enterprise, and that commitment is endorsed in the Gracious Speech at the start of this new Parliament.\\n In my constituency we share the real concern for those who are unfortunately without work. At the same time, we share the great pride in developing industries, often making use of the application of new technology. Hope for the unemployed rests primarily with the expansion and creation of companies, large and small, which are prepared to invest in the future and to capitalise on opportunities that present themselves.\\n The common-sense approach of my constituents recognises the value of the entrepreneur in stimulating the local economy through his enterprise. That common sense also recognises the fundamental truth that personal freedom is preferable to state direction. In this way growth will be promoted, from which comes employment.\\n Against the background of the highly successful pursuit of policies to curb inflation and of real signs of an upturn from recession, the Gracious Speech is surely right to emphasise the value of competitiveness and efficiency. At the same time it is also surely right to pay due attention to the importance of trade to our nation. That is particularly relevant in Welwyn-Hatfield, as exports from mid-Hertfordshire are substantial.\\n As its Member of Parliament, it is my aim always to put the interests of Welwyn-Hatfield first. It is undoubtedly in the interests of my constituency, and of the country, that the Government's intentions as outlined in the Gracious Speech receive wholehearted support. That I gladly give.   \n",
       "2        As we debate ALARM and future British weapons systems, we are considering not only that most important of Governmental tasks, the defence of the realm, but the development of expertise and technology without which the nation will be the poorer in stature and the more dependent on others. Additionally, the commercial and employment consequences are self-evident. It is regrettable that the SDP-Liberal alliance is not represented at this debate, which is well supported by Government Members.\\n It is vital that projects such as ALARM, with which my constituency has been closely connected, should receive the support of the Ministry of Defence and the RAF. It is also vital that other projects involving British Aerospace dynamics division, such as ASRAAM, should be afforded priority consideration for relevant Government commitment. That should also be the case for projects involving the British Aerospace aircraft division, such as the A320 airbus.\\n Britain has for long provided skill and innovation in aerospace which have been a source of justifiable pride and success. Denationalising British Aerospace has added lustre to an already outstanding industry, but inevitably there remains a role for the Government as both sponsor and purchaser. I have long campaigned, with certain positive results, for due recognition to be afforded to British Aerospace projects such as the 146 aircraft, the A300 airbus, the Sea Eagle missile and ALARM. the last named deserves the early and favourable decision for which my hon.

People see a Conservative Government who are getting on with uniting and levelling up, with the most ambitious agenda any Government have had for generations, and I think that is what they are listening to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

It is we who share their priorities on crime, on the NHS, on investment in infrastructure and on levelling up across our country, so I hope they will vote Conservative on 6 May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1801638  I first was made aware of the plan for a European super league on, I think, the Sunday night, and we acted decisively using the arsenal of legislative freedoms that we now have thanks to leaving the European Union, which the right hon. and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer) opposed, of course. We acted decisively to make clear that the UK Government took a dim view of this matter.

I hope that they will vote Conservative on 6 May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
